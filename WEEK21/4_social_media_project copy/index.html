<!-- 
  ->adding router to react 46 
  ->using fetch we learned how createpost can be added 
  >added routs removed selected tab function and removed onclick for home and create post buttons 
  ->for anchor tag of home and create post i added routes
  ->but there is a disadvantage on clicking a tags that page is completely again loading 

  -> to solve this added Link tag and to attribute instead of anchor tag 
   -> also added useNavigate hook and navigate method
